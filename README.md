# Arguebuf CLI

This project aims at providing some tools to simplify dealing with structured argument graphs.
Among others, it is possible to convert graphs between different formats, translate them, and render images using graphviz.
The library can easily be installed using pip:

`pip install arguebuf-cli`

Afterwards, you can execute it by calling `arguebuf`, for example:

`arguebuf --help`
